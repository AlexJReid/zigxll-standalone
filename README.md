# zigxll-standalone

A standalone Excel XLL add-in built with [ZigXLL](https://github.com/AlexJReid/zigxll).

This is a **template repository**. [Create your own repo from this template](https://github.com/AlexJReid/zigxll-standalone/generate) to get started quickly.

## Cross-compilation setup

Although Excel XLL assemblies only run on Windows, on non-Windows platforms ZigXLL cross-compiles Windows XLL add-ins from macOS or Linux with the help of the most excellent [xwin](https://jake-shadle.github.io/xwin/).

**Windows:**
Skip this section.

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install xwin
xwin --accept-license splat --output ~/.xwin
```

**Linux:**
```bash
cargo install xwin
xwin --accept-license splat --output ~/.xwin
```

If Cargo isn't available, install Rust via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) or download a prebuilt binary from the [xwin releases page](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/releases).

See the [ZigXLL README](https://github.com/AlexJReid/zigxll) for more details.

## Building the XLL

```bash
zig build
```

The XLL will be output to `zig-out/lib/standalone.xll`.

## Adding more functions

Add your Excel functions to `src/functions.zig` using the function in that file as a guide.
